### 🔍 Idea: **AI Interview Coach & Candidate Simulator**

**Concept:**  
Simulate mock job interviews using two Autogen agents:
- **Agent 1: Interviewer**
- **Agent 2: Candidate**

---

### 💡 How It Works:

- **Interviewer Agent**: Asks behavioral or technical questions based on a chosen job role (e.g., software engineer, data analyst).
- **Candidate Agent**: Responds based on its simulated resume, experience, or personality traits.
- You can set different tones or expertise levels (e.g., junior dev vs senior dev).

---

### 🛠️ Tech Highlights:
- Add prompts like:
  - Interviewer: “Ask challenging questions relevant to a frontend role.”
  - Candidate: “Respond confidently but modestly as a junior developer with internship experience.”
- You can toggle roles, feedback, or even insert a human-in-the-loop to coach the Candidate.

---

### 🔄 Bonus Twist:
- Let the **Interviewer** give **feedback after each answer** to help the **Candidate** improve.
- After the session, generate a **summary report** highlighting strengths and improvement areas.
